# TimeDistributed AlexNet for Video Classification with Gaussian Noise Injection

This repository contains the implementation of our **TimeDistributed AlexNet** model for classroom activity recognition.  
We evaluate the impact of **Gaussian noise injection** on improving model robustness and generalization.
